# WayFinder
WayFinder: A Recursive Puzzle Solver

The goal of this project is to implement a program that finds all solutions to a number puzzle. The solution that you will implement has to use a recursive algorithm to find all the ways through the puzzle.

The puzzle uses an array of positive integers. The objective is to find a path from index zero to the last index in the array. At each step we need to know the distance to be traveled and the direction. Each entry in the array is a number indicating the distance to be traveled on this particular leg of the path. The player (your program) needs to decide the direction (if the move should be made to the right or to the left).

The goal of this programming project is for you to master (or at least get practice on) the following tasks:

designing a program from scratch (deciding what classes and method should be part of the program)
writing recursive functions
